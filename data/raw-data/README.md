This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages useful for scientific work in Archaeology, grouped by topic. Note that this is not an official CRAN Task View, just one I have prepared for my own convenience, so it includes some packages only on GitHub and other non-CRAN resources I find useful. Many of the most highly recommended packages listed here can be installed in a single step by installing the [tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse) package.

Besides these packages, a very wide variety of functions suitable for scientific work in Archaeology is provided by both the basic R system (and its set of recommended core packages), and a number of other packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and [GitHub](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages?type=github). Consequently, several of the other CRAN Task Views may contain suitable packages, in particular the [Social Sciences](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/SocialSciences.html), [Spatial](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Spatial.html),  [Spatio-temporal](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/SpatioTemporal.html), [Cluster analysis](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Cluster.html), [Multivariate Statistics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Multivariate.html), [Bayesian inference](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html), [Visualization](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Graphics.html), and [Reproducible research](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html) Task Views. 

Contributions to this Task View are always welcome, and encouraged. The source file for this particular task view file resides in a GitHub repository (see below), and pull requests are the preferred method for contributions. 

**Data acquisition**

-  The ideal method is to export your spreadsheets from Excel (or whatever program you made them) as CSVs (comma-separated-values, a simple, non-proprietary plain-text-based format that is very transparent, being human-readable, easily machine-processable and suitable for archival storage) and read them into R using the base function `read.csv()`. Data in other types of plain text files can be read in with `read.table()`.
-  To read Microsoft Excel files into R there are a number of packages: [readxl]( https://github.com/hadley/readxl) (requires Rcpp, which in turn requires Rtools for Windows or XCode for OSX), [gdata](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gdata/index.html) (requires Perl), [openxlsx](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/openxlsx/index.html) (requires Rcpp, which in turn requires Rtools for Windows or XCode for OSX), [XLConnect](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/XLConnect/index.html) (requires [rJava](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rJava/index.html) and Java), [xlsx](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/xlsx/index.html) (also requires rJava and Java). OpenDocument Spreadsheet files can be read into R using [readODS](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/readODS/index.html). 
-  For working with untidy and/or complex Excel spreadsheets (i.e. many tables in one sheet, coloured cells, cells with formulas, etc.), use [jailbreakr](https://github.com/rsheets/jailbreakr), [xlsxtractr](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/xlsxtractr), [tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) and [unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr)
-  Text data (as in sentences and paragraphs) can be read in and analysed with the [tm](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tm/index.html) package or [tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidytext). If the text is in a Microsoft Word file, use [textreadr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textreadr), or if it's a PDF file, use [pdftools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pdftools). Text in image files can be extracted with [tesseract](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tesseract)
- Â  For quickly reading in a very large number of CSV files, or very large CSV files, use `fread()` from the [data.table](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/data.table/index.html) package or functions in the [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr) package. For plain text (CSV, TSV, etc) files that are too big to fit in memory, use [chunked](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=chunked) to read and operate on them in small chunks.
-   [RODBC](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RODBC/index.html), [RMySQL](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html), [RPostgreSQL](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RPostgreSQL/index.html), [RSQLite](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RSQLite/index.html) for connecting R to SQL databases. [RODBC](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RODBC/index.html) can connect to Microsoft Access databases. 
-   The [haven](https://github.com/hadley/haven) and [foreign](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/foreign/index.html) packages can be used for reading and writing files from certain versions of Minitab, S, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Systat and Weka. 
-   ESRI shapefiles can be read using [rgdal](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgdal/index.html) or [maptools](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/maptools/index.html)
- R can receive data directly from the web using [rvest](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rvest/index.html), [httr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/httr/index.html), [XML](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/XML/index.html), [jsonlite](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html), [RSelenium](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/index.html) (requires Selenium 2.0 Remote WebDriver). R can be programmed to be a web-scraper using rvest and/or rselenium. The [Web Technologies](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html) task view gives more details.
- Google spreadsheets can be read into R using the [googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets) package
- Tables can be read directly from Microsoft Word documents with [docxtractr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/docxtractr), and from PDF documents with [tabulizer](https://github.com/leeper/tabulizer)
- Datasets from the Open Context repository can be browsed and read into R using the [opencontext](https://github.com/ropensci/opencontext) package

**Data manipulation**

-   [dplyr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) and [data.table](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/data.table/index.html) for splitting the data up by groups, applying some common or custom functions, and combining the output back into a convenient form (ie. typical aggregation, splitting and summarising operations). Both packages are fast on very large datasets. 
- For cleaning, examining, and making quick summaries of data, [janitor](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor), [skimr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/skimr), [statar](https://github.com/matthieugomez/statar), and [xda](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/xda) maybe useful. [tabplot](https://github.com/mtennekes/tabplot/) has functions for exploratory data visualisation of tables

- [multipanelfigure](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multipanelfigure), perhaps the most versatile for combining different elements)

**Analysis in general**

-    Base R, especially the stats package, has a lot of functionality useful for analysing archaeological data. For example, `chisq.test()`, `prop.test()`, `binom.test()`, `t.test()`, `wilcox.test()`, `kruskal.test()`, `mcnemar.test()`, `cor.test()`, `power.t.test()`, `power.prop.test()`, `power.anova.test()` among many others. [Hmisc](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html) includes bootstrapping, setting confidence intervals, and power analysis functions, see also [psych](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html) for useful descriptive statistics and visualizations.
-    [corrr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/corrr/) contains many convenient functions for exploring correlations.
-    Bayesian and resampling variants of these also exist, for example in the [MCMCpack](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCMCpack/index.html), [BEST](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BEST/index.html) (requires JAGS), [Bayesian First Aid](https://github.com/rasmusab/bayesian_first_aid) (also requires JAGS) packages (see the [Bayesian](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html) task view for more) and the [coin](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/coin/index.html), [boot](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boot/index.html), and [bootstrap](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bootstrap/index.html) packages (see also [msm](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msm/index.html)).
-    For analysing change over time, [bcp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bcp/index.html), [changepoint](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/changepoint/index.html), [ecp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecp/index.html), [AnomalyDetection](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection) and [BreakoutDetection](https://github.com/twitter/BreakoutDetection) provide functions for detecting distributional changes within time-ordered observations.
-    [abc](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html) provides functions for parameter estimation, model selection, and goodness-of-fit.

**Analysis of categorical and count data**

- The `table()` function in the base package and the `xtabs()` and `ftable()` functions in the stats package construct contingency tables.
- The `chisq.test()` and `fisher.test()` functions in the stats package may be used to test for independence in two-way contingency tables
- The `assocstats()` function in the vcd package computes the Pearson chi-Squared test, the Likelihood Ratio chi-Squared test, the phi coefficient, the contingency coefficient and Cramer's V for plain or stratified contingency tables.

**Linear, generalized linear models, and non-linear models**

-  Linear models can be fitted (via OLS) with `lm()` (from stats). The [modelr](https://github.com/hadley/modelr) package has helper functions for pipeable modelling (e.g. cross-validation, bootstrapping). For data from a non-normal population, or when there are apparent outliers, [lmPerm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmPerm) computes linear models using permutation tests.
-  Bayesian fitting of linear and non-linear models is possible with [rstanarm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm),  [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms), and [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking).
-  The `nls()` function (from stats) as well as the package [minpack.lm](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/minpack.lm/index.html) allow the solution of nonlinear least squares problems.
- Correlated and/or unequal variances can be modeled using the `gnls()` function of the [nlme](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/nlme/index.html) package and by [nlreg](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/nlreg/index.html). The nlme package is supported by Pinheiro & Bates (2000) Mixed-effects Models in S and S-PLUS, Springer, New York. 
-  The generic `anova()` function in the [stats](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stats/index.html) package constructs sequential analysis of variance and analysis of deviance tables, and can compute F and likelihood-ratio tests for nested models. (It is typical for other classes of statistical models in R to have anova methods as well.) The generic anova function in the [car](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/car/index.html) package (associated with Fox, An R and S-PLUS Companion to Applied Regression, Sage, 2002) constructs so-called "Type-II" and "Type-III" tests for linear and generalized linear models.

Model Testing and Validation

- [caret](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/caret/index.html) provides many functions for model training, testing, and validation. There is also Max Kuhn's excellent companion book called "Applied Predictive Modeling" (Springer, also available as an ebook). The [mlr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr/index.html) package also provides classification, regression, and machine learning methods. 
-  Other packages that enable tuning and evaluation of models include bootstrap and [Hmisc](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html)
- The [CVtools](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/CVtools/index.html) and [DAAG](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/DAAD/index.html) packages include cross-validation functions for evaluating the optimality of tuning parameters such as sample sizes or number of predictors etc., in statistical models 
- [rsample](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsample) creates different types of resamples and corresponding classes for their analysis

Hierarchical cluster analysis

-    The package [cluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cluster/index.html) provides functions for cluster analysis following the methods described in Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990) Finding Groups in data: an introduction to cluster analysis, Wiley, New York
-    There are also `hclust()` in the stats package and `hcluster()` in [amap](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/amap/index.html)
-    [pvclust](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pvclust/index.html) is a package for assessing the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. It provides approximately unbiased p-values as well as bootstrap p-values. Enhanced plotting is also available through the [dendextend](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dendextend/index.html) package.
-    [dendextend](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dendextend/index.html) Offers a set of functions for extending dendrogram objects in R. It allows to both adjust a tree's graphical parameters - the color, size, type, etc of its branches, nodes and labels - as well as visually (and statistically) compare different dendrograms to one another.

Other partitioning methods

-   `kmeans()` in stats provides k-means clustering and cmeans() in [e1071](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/e1071/index.html) implements a fuzzy version of the k-means algorithm. The recommended package [cluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cluster/index.html) also provides functions for various partitioning methodologies.
-    To compute the optimum number of clusters there is the `pamk()` function in the [fpc](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fpc/index.html) package, `cascadeKM()` in [vegan](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/vegan/index.html), `Mclust()` in [mclust](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mclust/index.html), `apcluster()` in [apcluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/apcluster/index.html)

-   Principal coordinates analysis (PCO) is implemented in `dudi.pco()` in ade4, `pco()` in labdsv, `pco()` in [ecodist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecodist/index.html), and `cmdscale()` in package [MASS](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/MASS/index.html).
-    Non-Metric multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) is provided by `isoMDS()` in package MASS and `nmds()` in [ecodist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecodist/index.html). `nmds()`, a wrapper function for `isoMDS()`, is also provided by package [labdsv](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/labdsv/index.html). vegan provides helper function `metaMDS()` for `isoMDS()`, implementing random starts of the algorithm and standardised scaling of the NMDS results. The approach adopted by vegan with `metaMDS()` is the recommended approach for ecological data.
- `corresp()` and `mca()` in MASS provide simple and multiple correspondence analysis respectively. [ca](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ca/index.html) also provides single, multiple and joint correspondence analysis. `ca()` and `mca()` in ade4 provide correspondence and multiple correspondence analysis respectively, as well as adding homogeneous table analysis with `hta()`. Further functionality is also available within vegan co-correspondence is available from cocorresp. [FactoMineR](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html) provides `CA()` and `MCA()` which also enable simple and multiple correspondence analysis as well as associated graphical routines. [CAinterprTools](https://github.com/gianmarcoalberti/CAinterprTools) has functions for correspondence analysis and diagnostics. 
-    Seriation methods are available in [seriation](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/seriation/index.html), which includes `bertinplot()` for producing battleship plots, and [CAseriation](https://github.com/gianmarcoalberti/CAseriation) which also has a battleship plotting function. 
-    [tabula](https://github.com/nfrerebeau/tabula) provides methods to analyse and visualise archaeological count data (artifacts, faunal remains, etc.) using diversity measures and Ford (1962) and Bertin (1977) diagrams.

Dissimilarity coefficients

- `dist()` in standard package stats, `daisy()` in recommended package [cluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cluster/index.html), `vegdist()` in [vegan](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/vegan/index.html), `dsvdis()` in [labdsv](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/labdsv/index.html), `Dist()` in [amap](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/amap/index.html), `distance()` in [ecodist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecodist/index.html), a suite of functions in [ade4](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ade4/index.html), and [rdist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rdist/index.html) for very fast distance computations. 
- [simba](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/simba/index.html) provides functions for the calculation of similarity and multiple plot similarity measures with binary data (for instance presence/absence data)
- `distance()` in the [analogue](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/analogue/index.html) package can be used to calculate dissimilarity between samples of one matrix and those of a second matrix. The same function can be used to produce pair-wise dissimilarity matrices, though the other functions listed above are faster. `distance()` can also be used to generate matrices based on Gower's coefficient for mixed data (mixtures of binary, ordinal/nominal and continuous variables). Function `daisy()` in package [cluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cluster/index.html) provides a faster implementation of Gower's coefficient for mixed-mode data than `distance()` if a standard dissimilarity matrix is required. Function `gowdis()` in package [FD](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/FD/index.html) also computes Gower's coefficient and implements extensions to ordinal variables.
- [DistatisR](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/DistatisR/index.html) provides functions for three-way multidimensional scaling for the analysis of multiple distance/covariance matrices collected on the same set of observations.
- Simple and partial Mantel tests to compute the Mantel statistic as a matrix correlation between two dissimilarity matrices are available in [vegan](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/vegan/index.html) and [ecodist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecodist/index.html)
